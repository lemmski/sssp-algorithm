# FastSSSP Algorithm Implementation

## Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths

This repository contains a complete implementation of the **FastSSSP algorithm** that achieves **O(m log^{2/3} n)** time complexity for single-source shortest paths in directed graphs, breaking the traditional O(m + n log n) barrier.

## 📚 Original Paper

This implementation is based on the groundbreaking paper:

**"Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths"**

- Jiayi Mao (Tsinghua University)
- Xiao Mao (Stanford University)
- Xinkai Shu (Max Planck Institute for Informatics)
- Longhui Yin (Tsinghua University)

**Published in:** arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.17033 (2025)

**DOI:** [10.48550/arXiv.2504.17033](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.17033)

**Abstract:** We give a deterministic O(m log^{2/3} n) time algorithm for single-source shortest paths (SSSP) on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights in the comparison-addition model. This is the first result to break the O(m + n log n) time bound of Dijkstra's algorithm on sparse graphs, showing that Dijkstra's algorithm is not optimal for SSSP.

## 🎯 Algorithm Overview

The FastSSSP algorithm uses a **recursive partitioning approach** that combines:
- **Pivot selection** for graph partitioning
- **Bellman-Ford style relaxations** within partitions
- **Recursive subproblem solving** with distance bounds
- **Efficient frontier management**

### Key Innovation

Unlike traditional Dijkstra's algorithm which relies on sorting all vertices by distance, FastSSSP uses recursive partitioning to avoid the full sorting bottleneck, achieving a better asymptotic complexity for sparse graphs.
