"""
Implementation of the O(m log^{2/3} n) Single-Source Shortest Paths algorithm
for directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights.

Based on the algorithm described in: "Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths"
by Ran Duan, Jiayi Mao, Xiao Mao, Xinkai Shu, Longhui Yin

This algorithm combines Dijkstra's algorithm with Bellman-Ford through recursive partitioning
to achieve better than O(m + n log n) time complexity on sparse graphs.
